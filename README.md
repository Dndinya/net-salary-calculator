## Student Grade Generator
This is a student grading system
##### Description
This system is used to get salary deductions using purely javascript. It first uses the KRA rates to tax your monthly taxable income, which should exclude your benefits and allowances. This also applies for NHIF and NSSF deductions, they are not subjected to the allowances and benefits. All the deductions are only subjected to the basic Salary. The systems runs on the node js. This makes node js installation mandatory. There is is a sample salary amount of 50000 kenyan shillings and benefits of 10000 kenyan shillings  before calling of the function "calculateNetSalary". These values are just examples to show that the system works you can use values of your choosing or that works in your situation.
